As of July 2018, I was part of the very talented digital team at the New York Public Library as the senior visual designer. For the majority of my time there, I was the only designer, so my work spanned many projects and disciplines. From initial product ideation with stakeholders and content managers, UX and Interface design to building functional prototypes with HTML, SASS and on many occasions wrestling with React (though I had ace engineers to help me out when needed). We also designed and built a Jekyll based Design Toolkit a reusable component library and overall style and principals guide.

For the last year, I have been on an intense, self-directed Javascript journey. I want to be as proficient with JS as I am with more static design tools.

I am highly proficient working with the Adobe Creative Suite. I have strong expertise working with the Sketch app, InVison, and Avocode. Over the last few years, I've grown quite comfortable working with command line tools such as git, npm, svgo, and a variety of others related to graphics production.

I started my design career in the 5th grade by entering and winning a “crazy t-shirt” contest. My love for typography stems from doing graffiti and painting murals. My passion for art and design has spanned many years. From punk rock show fliers made with Xerox machines and X-Acto knives, through skateboard graphics through my training as an offset printing press operator, I've always wanted to be an artist and designer.

I have been living and working in New York City since 2005. I am originally from Albuquerque New Mexico. I have a wife, two kids, two cats, and an old house. In my spare time, I mess around with a CNC machine in my cellar. I am fascinated by how technology shapes our lives, culture and relationships with each other and the world as a whole. From time to time I dust off my skateboard and cruise around and make some turns.

I’m available for projects. Let's talk!
