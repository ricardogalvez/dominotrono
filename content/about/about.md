As of July 2018, I was part of the very talented digital team at the New York Public Library as the senior visual designer. For most of my time there, I was the only designer, so my work spanned many projects and disciplines. I played an integral in initial product ideation with stakeholders and content managers, UX, and Interface design to building functional prototypes with HTML, SASS, and on many occasions working with React (though I had ace engineers to help me out when needed). We also designed and built a Jekyll based Design Toolkit, a reusable component library, and a style and principals guide.

I am highly proficient with the Adobe Creative Suite. I have strong expertise working with the Sketch app, InVison, and Avocode. Over the last few years, I’ve grown quite comfortable working with command-line tools such as git, npm, svgo, and various others related to graphics production. During the last year, I have been on an intense, self-directed JavaScript journey. I want to be as proficient with JavaScript as I am with more static design tools. This site has been handcrafted and coded with CSS Grids, SASS, and JavaScript. I manage the content via the static site generator Hugo, using a highly modified version of the “Blank” theme.

I started my design career in the 5th grade by entering and winning a “crazy t-shirt” contest. My love for typography stems from being a graffiti writer and painting murals in New York and Philadelphia. My passion for art and design spans many years. From punk rock show fliers produced at Kinko’s with X-Acto knives, glue sticks, and xerox machines through skateboard graphics through my training as an offset printing press operator, I’ve always been an artist and designer.

I have been living and working in New York City since 2005. I am originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I have a wife, two kids, two cats, and an old house. In my spare time, I mess around with a CNC machine in my cellar. From time to time, I dust off my skateboard, cruise around and carve lines in space-time.

I’m available for projects. [Let's talk!](mailto:ricardo.e.galvez@gmail.com)
