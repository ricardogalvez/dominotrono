The idea here is to briefly jot down activities, changes, inquiries, research topics etc, so as to better document and gauge progress on this site specifically and growth as a artist, designer and developer in general.
### 2-20-2019
2 hours work on JS tutorials, then a good chunk of the day was spent futzing w/ an animation idea, that still needs work.
### 2-19-2019
Admin stuff around the casa. Mostly opening mail, rearranging piles of paper work and bills paid. Woo. Some code, but nothing substantial.
### 2-18-2019
Did some work on that old coffee maker project. Set up Go on my computers.
### 2-17-2019
Working w/ SQIB: https://github.com/technopagan/sqip on my way to implementing something w/ `intersectionObserver`.
Rewrote the masthead... too.

### 2-16-2019
In the post grid, removed the `overflow: hidden` so focus and hover rings are fully visible
In same, added `aria` attributes so a screen reader might make more sense of it all. I should consider wrapping the entire block in a link instead.
