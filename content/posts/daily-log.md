The idea here is to briefly jot down activities, changes, inquiries, research topics etc, so as to better document and gauge progress on this site specifically and growth as a artist, designer and developer in general.

### 9-4-2019

Yeah, went on hiatus in a big way. Swore off web design several times. But the reality is, I dont have many other prosepects. So I've come to terms w/ a few things; Imposter syndrome, fear and loathing of office life. I need to have creative control and outlets. Employment that is purely transactional, is not the way I want to live. I will also start modifying this site design to showcase more of my fine art and other design endeavors and interests. Today I am kicking off the new Notch 2.0 project. Basically getting reacquainted w/ Shopify, Liquid and Sketch. I will also be doing a revamp of my web project page(s) into a more coherent case study format, starting with the Notch project.

### 3-12-2019

So, the idea was to do this little journal entry every day... So today, I fixed up a bunch of portfolio pages, finalized the social media icons using `<use>` and `<svg>`. Want to circle back w/ hugo params or data so this can be a loop instead of hard coded, works nicely though. Fixed some other radom things as well. And lastly, I need to catch up w/ my #100DaysOfCode project.

### 3-1-2019

Went down a PostCSS rabbit hole...And then thought better of it, and started setting up a new domain. Added the skills section to the home page. TODO: make some nice graphics design for each set...

### 2-28-2019

More work on the mobile nav. Needed styling. TODO: Close on click _outside_ of nav area...ðŸ¤”

### 2-27-2019

Added a very basic mobile nav to the site. Needs accessibility testing.

### 2-26-2019

Using FontFaceObserver to bring nicer fonts, was getting a bit tired of the system fonts, and as a designer we want the snazz. So snazz was brought, with help from Adobe Typekit, as I did not want to use the other service that shall not be named.

### 2-20-2019

2 hours work on JS tutorials, then a good chunk of the day was spent futzing w/ an animation idea, that still needs work.

### 2-19-2019

Admin stuff around the casa. Mostly opening mail, rearranging piles of paper work and bills paid. Woo. Some code, but nothing substantial.

### 2-18-2019

Did some work on that old coffee maker project. Set up Go on my computers.

### 2-17-2019

Working w/ SQIB: https://github.com/technopagan/sqip on my way to implementing something w/ `intersectionObserver`.
Rewrote the masthead... too.
