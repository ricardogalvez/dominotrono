## On Code Camping and N days of code...

I've been on quest to become a front end developer. My approach has been do as many tutorials as possible, some free and some paid for. My favorite so far are from Wes Bos, Free Code Camp and a smattering of tutorials found on Lynda dot com (did you know your local library might offer _all_ of Lynda for free with your library card?! Check it out!)

I feel like I should document my journey in some way, so I'm doing it here. In fact, I should keep a log of doings on this site in general. Perhaps weekly log, or probably a more appropriate approach would be to orient the posts as an expression of the work done. So for example, I've been working on getting this `svg` hover issue sorted out and have been chasing my tail big time. Or paheraps I can detail the works on responsive images and why I've taken the path there, what with all the `srcsetting` and what not. 

I can confidently say I've been doing a solid 6 days a week of code, with usually about 6-8 hours of tutorials, work here, generally mucking about on codepen.io (usually breaking stuff I like so I can see how its all done.)
