## bungling the config file
* just use a theme

##  plan out the next iterations
* porting the drupal site?
  * headache to be sure
* start simple: small log of days activities
* writing about learning stuff
  * cnc
  * struggle w/ ````js````
  * amassing books but not reading with the intent of thorough attention
    * i'd like to rectify
* what is the portfolio really looking like these days
  * code quality is probably just as important as design
