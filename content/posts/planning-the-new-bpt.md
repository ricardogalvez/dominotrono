Thinking about how this site will be structured is all fine and good, but what about the content? Beyond these ramblings, I think it would be good to present a better picture of _what kind_ content will be in this site.

I don't mind terribly the way the old site is, with portfolio centric content. I do plan on integrating more coding experiments as I improve my skills with Javascript (and any other languages I might be interested in... I'm looking at you Processing and Python).

As an aside, I should really come up with good reasons for wanting to learn Python & Processing... Processing is easy: its a defacto language for artists working with data & code to create unique works of art. Python... I don't have a good reason why and therefore I should find on or not worry about learning it.

A few points about the site's content. It should be a repository of all my creative endeavors. Code, Plastic Arts, Industrial designs etc. To that end, it should be accessible, not only will that demonstrate good faith for any potential viewers, but it will be great practice in implementation.

Some things that still need doing before long:

* typography needs improving
* better layout for various viewports
* serving images to the site
  * some sort of CDN
* ???
* Documentation of the evolution of the site
  * it would be cool to have screen shots after each commit
  * some sort of shell script might be in order
* Fix the about page
  * should be a combination of bio and resume, w/ a downloadable resume or just have a really good `print.css` file set up.
* Move this site an logogogo out of my nypl github account
* do a better job of documentation in general

Oveall the whole point of this exercise to get better at web development in general w/ an emphasis on the front end

  * `svg`
  * animations
  * `css`
