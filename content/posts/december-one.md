The big task today, is to start refactoring the scss on this site. There is a large amount of bloaty type styles and I am pretty sure I can make significant reductions, leverage CSS custom proerties and do a better job of using SASS.

Step one: Refactor the blog pages!
Step two: start using the modular scales instead of magic numbers...
