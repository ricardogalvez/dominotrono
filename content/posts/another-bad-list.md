## A summer project:
I've been having a rough go of it lately, trouble w/ work, difficulty parenting, struggling w/ imposter syndrome. In order to be healtier and happier, the efforts to achieve happiness and fulfillment are tied directly to overcoming obstacles. Getting work done is a good way to start, spending more time w/ kids and generally being more productive I think is good way to combat feelings of worthlessness and depression. That said, my list below will be my marching orders and mantra for the rest of the summer.

- stop being offended
- start working on meaningful shit, that is meaninful to you
- stop the kneecapping

- resume up
- finish one tutorial series a week
- read one chapter from design, ux book over week,
    - think on it
    - write on it

- play with kids

- draw

- call dentist
- call the NY State Revenue

- project back burner
    - take down old drupal site
        - double check local works as expected
    - finish morse code thing
    - finish type face in current work sketch book
        - get into svg format
