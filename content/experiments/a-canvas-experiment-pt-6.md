This is moving right along. Faithful readers will now see I have created a custom Hugo short-code that allows us to easily embed canvas elements into a markdown file. Yeah. I've also configured Gulp to concatenate and uglify the javascript so we can use multiple project files to work from but we serve a nice minified and concatenated javascript file. Next up... lets do the same minifiying to our css shall we?
