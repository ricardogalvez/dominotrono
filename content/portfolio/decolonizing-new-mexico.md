          Decolonizing New Mexico is meant to enter gather historical context and ideas toward the development of a process, centering truth and transformation in New Mexico. The project is designed with flexibility for growth and expansion as new material created and added. I designed the entire project to as lean as possible. The design work was executed in Adobe XD, the site is built with Hugo. For hosting, we us Netlify and Forestry as the CMS for easy and very intuitive content management.

      For full disclosure Dr. Galvez and myself are first cousins. The project grew out of an informal consulting relationship when Dr. Galvez contacted me for advice on how he should go about creating and publishing his paper <i>"Decolonizing New Mexico"</i> to his website. Rather than bury this extensive piece in in PDF form there, I suggested we create a website around this important and timely piece, as a result of a number of conversations, this project was born.

      This project was also a first for me due to the fact that all the layout and design work was executed with Adobe XD. While initally I felt hampered by the unfamiliar interface, overall I think its a fine product and will use it again.
