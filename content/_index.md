I am an artist, designer, and developer. I live at the intersection of creativity and implementation. This site is built and maintained with love and dedication using the static site generator Hugo. I use Sketch and Illustrator for design. I bring my work to life with Javascript and CSS. I am passionate about making the web accessible for all.
