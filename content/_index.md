Hi, I am a full stack designer (is that thing? Lets just consider it a thing). I am interested in unusual interfaces, animation with CSS, SVG and Javascript. To confound that a bit I am also dedicated to building Accessible interfaces. I like working with non-profit organizations and small businesses. I am forever interested in doing a nice paint-job on the hood and but also obsessing about  whats going on is a super power of mine. I want to know how the clock ticks...
