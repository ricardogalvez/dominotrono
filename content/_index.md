This site is built and maintained with love and dedication. Much has gone into it, and will continue to do so. Its built with <a href=" https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hugo </a>, sass, vanilla javascript. I use gulp, git and tools such as Sketch and Illustrator for design. CSS Grids and some SVGs are at play as well. I am deeply invested in making the web accessible for all, so this site adheres to WCAG 2.0 standards. And it turns out this page / site is having quite the performance difficulties, so I'll be attending to that.
