This site is built and maintained with love and dedication. Much has gone into it, and will continue to do so. Its built with <a href=" https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">hugo </a>, sass, vanilla javascript. I use gulp, git and some standard tools for design. CSS Grids and some SVGs are at play as well. I am deeply invested in making the web accessible for all, so this site adheres to WCAG 2.0 standards.
