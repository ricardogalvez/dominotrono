I am an artist, designer, and developer. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and implementation. My site has been built by hand and maintained with love and dedication. I use the static site generator Hugo. I use Sketch and Illustrator for design, and prefer to code early in my process. I bring my work to life with Javascript and CSS. I am dedicated to making all of my projects accessible, functional and beautiful.
