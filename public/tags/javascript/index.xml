      <description>This project is to fulfill a couple ends. The first is purely for professional development and add new and relevant work to my portfolio. The idea is to create a &amp;ldquo;mock&amp;rdquo; product and run it through from basic concept to a finished product complete w/ screen designs, work flows, functional and technical specs. While it may never see the light of day in terms of a real, functional product, I think that, as a project demonstrating the breadth of my abilities it will be apparent.</description>

      <title>Getting Gulp and Others</title>

      <description>What do you need gulp.js for anyway? The whole point is to learn a few things, where to start? I suppose with fundamentals. I&amp;rsquo;ve been avoiding JS for years. It was in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s when I came across a JS book and I did some examples and ran through the chapters. None of it stuck. I blamed it on poor writing and inadequate documentation. Really, though, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t grok some of the concepts and gave up.</description>
