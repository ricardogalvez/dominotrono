      <description>This project is to fulfill a couple ends. The first is purely for professional development and add new and relevant work to my portfolio. The idea is to create a &amp;ldquo;mock&amp;rdquo; product and run it through from basic concept to a finished product complete w/ screen designs, work flows, functional and technical specs. While it may never see the light of day in terms of a real, functional product, I think that, as a project demonstrating the breadth of my abilities it will be apparent.</description>

      <description>We want to put the canvas as a whole big background image&amp;hellip; It might be prudent or useful to put a custom scss shortcode here as well?</description>

      <description>Thinking about how this site will be structured is all fine and good, but what about the content? Beyond these ramblings, I think it would be good to present a better picture of what kind content will be in this site.
I don&amp;rsquo;t mind terribly the way the old site is, with portfolio centric content. I do plan on integrating more coding experiments as I improve my skills with Javascript (and any other languages I might be interested in&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Processing and Python).</description>

      <title>Why Fluid Type</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with fluid type for a while now.
 It makes sense to decouple from device based viewport sizes  follows the principle of: Make layout improvements when the it looks bad at a certain viewport size   </description>

      <title>A Canvas Experiment Pt 6</title>

      <description>This is moving right along. Faithful readers will now see I have created a custom Hugo short-code that allows us to easily embed canvas elements into a markdown file. Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve also configured Gulp to concatenate and uglify the javascript so we can use multiple project files to work from but we serve a nice minified and concatenated javascript file. Next up&amp;hellip; lets do the same minifiying to our css shall we?</description>

      <title>Getting Gulp and Others</title>

      <description>What do you need gulp.js for anyway? The whole point is to learn a few things, where to start? I suppose with fundamentals. I&amp;rsquo;ve been avoiding JS for years. It was in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s when I came across a JS book and I did some examples and ran through the chapters. None of it stuck. I blamed it on poor writing and inadequate documentation. Really, though, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t grok some of the concepts and gave up.</description>

      <description> bungling the config file  just use a theme  plan out the next iterations  porting the drupal site?  headache to be sure  start simple: small log of days activities writing about learning stuff  cnc struggle w/ js amassing books but not reading with the intent of thorough attention i&amp;rsquo;d like to rectify  what is the portfolio really looking like these days  code quality is probably just as important as design   </description>
